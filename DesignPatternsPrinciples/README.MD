- Say 2 design patterns
- What does Singleton do?
- Will Singleton behave the same way in a multi-threaded situation?
- What is dependency injection?
- Which design principle does it implement?
- When do we use dependency injection (in general and in the chosen language)?



dependency injection: we use it for testing, also typical in Java Spring

- What is Reflection and what do we use it for?
  * Reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.
  * We use it for loading modules/classes from assembly and create an instance of them at runtime; getting an object's public attributes (like type); creating testing mock objects; to create Generics (implicit late bounging); building new types in runtime;
