- Say 2 design patterns
- What does Singleton do?
- Will Singleton behave the same way in a multi-threaded situation?
- What is dependency injection?
- Which design principle does it implement?
- When do we use dependency injection (in general and in the chosen language)?



dependency injection: we use it for testing, also typical in Java Spring
