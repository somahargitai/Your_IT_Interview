- What is a Promise?

A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future. A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

- What is an arrow function in __ES6__?
An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression.

You can replace a function:
```
function timesTwo(params) {
  return params * 2
}
timesTwo(4); 
```
to:
```
var timesTwo = params => params * 2
timesTwo(4); 
```
