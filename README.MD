# Your IT Interview
This is an info collection about IT interviews. Primarily it aims at helping juniors to prepare themselves for a job interview. I have also added some [recommendations for technical interviewers, employers](ForInterviewers).

__!important__:
This collection is not a kit for learning but for challenging your knowledge. You have to go through learning materials and to code a lot to gather your knowledge. This collection provides a feedback for yourself and it shows not only _what_ interviewers usually ask but _how_ they do it.  
If you need a guide how you should start coding or how to structure your learning plan, I have a [short introduction here](https://gist.github.com/somahargitai/746e8b2bd011f185d11a302b9380ba72) on how to start programming and will publish soon publish a 

### Languages
You can read interview questions here for all the main programming languages and technologies*. I hope to be able soon to write detailed solutions and code snippets for them:
- JavaScript technologies: [core JavaScript](JavaScript/README.MD), [Node.js](JavaScript/README.MD)
- OOP and OOP supporting languages: [C\#](C#/README.MD) , [Java](Java/README.MD), [C\+\+](C++/README.MD)
- Script languages: [Python](Python/README.MD)

### Database & Test
- [Testing questions](Testing/README.MD)
- [Database questions](Database/README.MD)

### Exercises
Many hiring processes contain exercises. All types may occur: fast tests, on-the-spot coding, home assignments.
- Home Assignments - 2 to 3 hours long coding challenges
- Ticking tests - see such questions in the __Languages__ section
- Short coding exercises - typicly you should solve such exercises during the interview or you have 5-10 minutes to work on them and then you should perform your solution

*_What is a programming language?_  
_It is a regular question how we should define programming concepts. Many people point out loud that HTML is not a programming language and we have regular problems about deciding if a given technology is a language, a platform, an environment, a library or other entity. If you are interested in such questions, visit my [Theoretical Programming FAQ](https://gist.github.com/somahargitai/b37168697a26180d772c255c6414eb16), but here I will be remiss on this question and put Node.js to the group of languages._
